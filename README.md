This project is about creating a simple shell.  
Minishell features:  
- working history
- redirections (<, >, <<, >>)
- pipes
- environment variables
- $? for the exit status
- signals (ctrl-c, ctrl-d, ctrl-\)
- built-ins (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit) without options


Project was done on Linux, not working on Mac as the readline function rl_replace_line does not exist on Mac.
